  <strong><em>Why do I want to learn web development?</em></strong>

  <ol>

    <li>
      <p>What does it mean to you? What are your motivations? Will you prove something to yourself or people around you? Will you get a raise because you’re better at your job or will you get a better job?</p>
      <em>I want to create my own beautiful websites which will take the user's breath away and inspire to do beautiful things as well. My current motivations are various YouTube bloggers and other professional website designers. If I learn how to
        build websites, I'll prove to myself that I can do whatever I want, if I really set my mind to it and I'll be very proud and happy with myself. I actually want to start my own company for building beautiful websites. I think it will be very
        useful for other people as well. For example, I want to build websites for people who want to showcase their resume, their skills and other work. Also, I want to build websites for various companies, who are already successful but who still
        need their own websites.

    <li>
      <p>What will I achieve if I learn this skill? Which doors will this skill open for you? Will you be able to earn more, have more flexibility in your work hours, work remotely and travel more?
      </p>
      <em>I'll achieve a lot: first, I'll gain more confidence, and I'll finally say: "I did it, after so many years of planning to do it! I'm very happy." Second: I'll finally add more work/skills to my resume, because I'm very worried that
        currently
        my resume specializes only in one very unknown field and employers find it hard to understand what my skills are. Thirdly: web development will open new doors for me in terms of employment, I hope that I'll be able to apply for
        front-developer
        positions now, not just research scientist, as what I'm currently looking for. I also hope that with this skill I can work remotely, and sort of have a really useful hobby, where I can be creative and make other people happy.

    <li>
      <p>How will this skill change my life and my career?Would you get a raise at your current job or more respect from your boss once you’ve learnt this skill? Or will you be at Facebook, Amazon or Google instead? How would your life change?
      </p>
      <em>I hope that this skill will open new doors for me, both in terms of employment and in terms of being happy with my job.
      </em>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family, friends and coworkers? What will you be able to do for your family or friends once you’ve learnt this skill? How will it change the way they think of you? Will your coworkers
        respect
        you more?
      </p>
      <em>Once I've learnt this skill, I hope I can produce gorgeous personal websites for my family and my friends. I also want to build a beautiful website for my dad's medical company so that he can work in a more efficient and safe way.
      </em>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>How will I feel if I never accomplish this? Would you feel disappointed? Would you feel like you’ve missed out?</p>
      <em>I'll feel like I'm not the person of my word. If I said I'm going to do it, I want to finally learn how to do it, even if it took me already 6 years to finally start doing this course. I'll also feel very disappointed and frustrated with
        myself. I'll feel like I've lost another chance to become a better version of myself.
      </em>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this? Visualise it. What would life look like from the moment you wake up to the time you go to sleep? Will you be living by the sea? Would you kiss your beautiful wife/husband when you
        wake up?
      </p>
      <em>If I manage to accomplish this, I can finally start my own business, work from home, spend more time with my family and kids, learn new languages, bake delicious recipes for my family, etc. Moreover, with the new skills, I really want to
        find
        a great job in Europe or the US, where I can work doing what I love and meet new people, and learn from them and share the new skills and knowledge with them, and become really great friends for life.
